My first text editors for development were Atom, followed by Visual Studio Code. I learned Git through VS Code and itâ€™s the main way I interact with Github up until now. 

Visual Studio 22 has a complete suite of options for using Git and I will demonstrate below how to set it up and use it for your projects.

### Initialize a new repository with Visual Studio
When you have a project you want to add to Github:
- Add to Source Control > Git > Create and Push

### Commit and push a change to the application repo
Make a change to the project.
 A red tick beside file in solution explorer indicate uncommitted changes
- Right-click project name > Git > Commit or Stash
- Add commit message (M stands for modified)
- Click + (stage all)
- Click Commit Staged -> commit now staged locally
- Click push button -> remote repo now updated

### Share a repo with a team or partner
Github > Settings > Collaborators > Add People -> add email addresses

### Clone a repository from Github
- Click Clone a Repository when Visual Studio starts
- Add url or repo and click Clone

### Create a branch of a repo and checkout
Make change, then:
- Master > New Branch
- Add branch name > Create
(Set for checkout which means it will switch to the new version automatically)
- Then commit changes locally, as above
- Click push

Can then do Pull request to merge branch into repo. Can delete the branch, once merged.
