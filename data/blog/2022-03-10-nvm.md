It can be very useful to have more than one version of Node.JS available on your machine. If I'm trying to run an older repo with lots of dependenices I'll revert back to an earlier release of Node.

To do this we can use NVM. (Node Version Manager)


### Steps are as follows:
- Uninstall all versions of node on your machine, this is necessary and probably a good idea to note your current version before doing so.
- Go to the Git Install section on NVM's github and follow these instructions:
https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#git-install
- download the nvm-setup.zip from nvm-windows releases here:
https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases
- install that .exe as an administrator
- now we'll install out first version of node. Choose carefully as it will be your default version from now on:
nvm install 17.5.0
- open a command prompt as administrator and enter:
nvm use 17.5.0
- node -v will give that version now
- nvm install (other node version)
e.g.
nvm install 14.9.0
- nvm use 14.9.0
- nvm list will show all installed versions

You now have multiple versions of node at your disposal :)
