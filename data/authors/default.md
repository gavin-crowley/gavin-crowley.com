I'm a JavaScript developer specialised in the development of React apps and websites. I also have experience with WordPress.

In a previous life I worked as a data analyst with Apple but the web called me and I now love to craft quality web experiences.

I'm also a musician - here I am playing classical guitar at a friend's wedding in Ireland.
